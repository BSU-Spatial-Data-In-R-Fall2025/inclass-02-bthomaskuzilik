# Your first Quarto Document

For today's in-class work, you'll learn a few of the features of Quarto and get to practice using version control to track your changes to this document.

## Add some more details to the Header

Modify the yaml header to include your name and affiliation. Save the document and commit the changes.

## Write some text

I am from [Boise, ID]{style="color:red;"}. I will be researching *systematic conservation planning and maybe also how to incorporate movement ecology into these plans because it's fun and I can't let it go*.

Save the document and commit your change

## Write some code

```{r sumbirth}
11 + 17 + 1991
```

## Render the document

Assuming everything worked correctly you should now have a file named `inclass02.html`

Commit both the final `.qmd` file and the `.html` file together.

## Push your changes
